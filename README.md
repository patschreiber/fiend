```

A browser-based game with a custom engine, built in TypeScript.

## Development

### Spin up

```npm
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Watch for changes
yarn run gulp -o --watch
```

Files are generated in the `dist/` directory.

### Upgrading Dependencies

```shell
yarn outdated
yarn upgrade-interactive
yarn install
```

If there are outdated packages, update `package.json` with the correct versions and run `yarn install` again.

### Build a release

```shell
yarn install --check-files

# Runs `gulp docgen` and `gulp default`, which compiles the game.
yarn run build
```

### Documentation generation

A fresh copy of the documentation can be generated by running the following
command from the root of the project.

```shell
docgen
```

# VS Code Handy Commands

Remove unused imports:
`option` + `shift` + `O`

## Naming Files

### Class File

## Directory Structure

A core engine feature should have a capitalized name and be a direct child of
the `engine/` directory.

```ts
import { IComponent } from "./interfaces/IComponent";
import { Component } from "./Component";

/**
 * The ColliderComponent component class.
 * Allows a [[GameActor]] to collide with other objects.
 *
 * This component is part of the physics system.
 *
 * @extends [[Component]]
 */
export class ColliderComponent extends Component implements IComponent {
  /**
   * The Lifeforce component.
   */
  private static readonly _typeId = "ColliderComponent";

  /**
   * Retrieves the type id of the component. Used when fetching or checking a
   * specific component for a [[GameObject]].
   */
  public getTypeId(): string {
    return ColliderComponent._typeId;
  }
}
```

### Good

```fs
.src/
├── engine/
│   ├── GameObject
│   │   ├── GameObject.ts
```

### Bad

```fs
.src/
├── engine/
│   ├── gameobj/
│   │   ├── GameActor/
│   │   │   ├── GameActorGameObject.ts
│   │   │   └── Player.ts
```
